                Hey, my name is Richie Tarkowski, and I'm a Software Engineer living in the great land of central Illinois! I really enjoy building user experiences, such as mobile apps and websites, though I have an interest in tech and software dev in general. I have experience in Flutter, React, Angular, and ASP.NET.
                <br /> <br />
                I should also mention that the most important thing about me is my faith in Christ. He has transformed my life and my trust is in Him <span className='heart'> â™¡ </span>
